1)basic
for x in range(0,150):
    print(x)

2)Print all the multiples of 5 from 5 to 1,000
for x in range(5,1000,5):
    print(x)

3)Print integers 1 to 100. If divisible by 5,
 print "Coding" instead. If divisible by 10, print "Coding Dojo".
for x in range(1,100):
 if x / 5 :
    	print("coding")
    elif x / 10:
    	print("coding dojo") 

4)Add odd integers from 0 to 500,000, and print the final sum.
 sum = 0
for x in range(1, 500001, 2):
    sum += x
print("The sum=",sum)

5) Print positive numbers starting at 2018, counting down by fours.
for x in range(2018,0,-4):

6)Set three variables: lowNum, highNum, mult. Starting at lowNum and going 
through highNum, print only the integers that are a multiple of mult. For example,
 if lowNum=2, highNum=9, and mult=3, the loop should print 3, 6, 9 (on successive lines)
lowNum = 2
highNum = 9
mult = 3
for x in range(lowNum, highNum):
    if x % mult == 0:
        print(x)
